# Travelshare

Travelshare is a full-stack Web application coded and designed fully and solely by me.  
Travelshare was my Senior thesis for finishing the University and getting the bachelor's degree.  
I received the highest grade for the thesis :)

# Description

### What is Travelshare

Travelshare is a social media Web application that allows you to share photos of your latest travels, or well, any travels you'd like. It also allows you to browse other people's posts, "heart" those posts, follow other users and visit any registered user's profile.

### Technologies used

To create Travelshare I've used React combined with JavaScript and plain CSS for styling the application.

### Project structure approach

I structured the application in 3 different directories.

Posts directory for components and layouts related to user posts.  
Users directory for components and layouts related to users, such as user profile etc.  
Shared directory for components and layouts shared throughout the whole project, meaning that they are used in both the components related to users and components related to posts.

The assets directory contains necessary assets such as images, svg's or any additional application data.

### Design decisions

When it came down to designing Travelshare, I decided to use bright, pastel colors with a very modern approach of slightly curved edges of items on the page because I thought it provides an easy on the eyes, soft experience.  
I used pastel light blue, HEX code #85CBCC, as my main color for the application.  
The application doesn't display a lot of elements at once inside the browser window. My reasoning for that was making the application simple and intuitive for the end user, not cluttering the viewport with needless elements and distractions.

### Project challenges

This whole project was, at that time, by far my greatest and most difficult project.  
It included structing a whole application both for frontend and backend. I've used many resources and watched many tutorials to have this working at the end.  
I've used custom hooks, different sorts of middleware and application context for the first time while building this.  
It was an amazing learning experience for me, learning a lot about React and how React works and it also allowed me to learn basics of backend development as well.

After everything was built, I also learned how to deploy an application, both frontend and backend.

# How to check out the project

Ever since Heroku stopped providing their free tier, the application has been shut down so there is currently no way of viewing the application besides cloning the project locally and running it.  
I do have to note that the project was built a while ago and has not been, nor is currently being maintained so most of the dependencies are outdated.
